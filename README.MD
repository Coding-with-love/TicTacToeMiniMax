Here's a `README.md` for your **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in C++:

# Tic-Tac-Toe (C++ Version)

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using C++. The game allows a human player to compete against an AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible move and ensure competitive gameplay. The human player can choose their marker (X or O), and the game proceeds turn by turn until a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Features

- **Two Player Mode**: Human vs. AI
- **Minimax Algorithm**: AI uses the minimax algorithm to always make the best possible move.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Choose your marker (X or O) at the start.
- **Command-line Interface**: Simple text-based interface for ease of play.
- **Winning Logic**: Detects a winner or a tie and provides feedback after each game.

## How to Play

1. Choose whether you want to be "X" or "O".
2. You will be prompted to enter a move (1-9) corresponding to a position on the board:
    ```
    1 | 2 | 3
    ---+---+---
    4 | 5 | 6
    ---+---+---
    7 | 8 | 9
    ```
3. The AI will make its move after yours, and the game will continue until either you or the AI wins, or the game ends in a tie.

## Example Gameplay

```
Choose your marker (X/O): X

   |   |   
---+---+---
   |   |   
---+---+---
   |   |   

Enter your move (1-9): 5

   |   |   
---+---+---
   | X |   
---+---+---
   |   |   

Computer places 'O' in position 1.

 O |   |   
---+---+---
   | X |   
---+---+---
   |   |   

...
```

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: You will need a C++ compiler such as g++ or clang.

### Compilation

To compile the program, navigate to the directory where the source file is located and use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp
```

### Running the Game

After compiling, run the executable with:

```bash
./tic_tac_toe
```

The game will then begin, prompting you to choose your marker.

## Code Structure

- **printBoard**: Displays the current state of the game board.
- **checkWin**: Checks if a player has won by comparing the board state against predefined winning conditions.
- **isBoardFull**: Checks if the board is full to determine if the game ends in a tie.
- **minimax**: Implements the Minimax algorithm to recursively find the best move for the AI.
- **bestMove**: Determines the best possible move for the AI based on the Minimax algorithm.
- **main**: The core game loop that handles user input, AI moves, and checks for wins or ties.

## Minimax Algorithm

The AI in this game is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. It evaluates all possible game outcomes and always picks the move that leads to the best possible result for the AI. Here's how it works:

- If the AI wins, it returns a score of `10 - depth`.
- If the human player wins, it returns a score of `depth - 10`.
- If the game is tied, it returns `0`.
- The depth parameter ensures that quicker wins are favored over delayed wins.
